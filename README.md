This project was done for a competition held in BRAC University. Our project was smart fire alarming system which works on detection of any combustible gases like methene, lpg gas and carbon-mono-oxide gas. When any of these gases is detected, it makes a fire alarm and automatically turns on exhaust fan and turn off the gas vulve by a servo  motor. Also sends an message and phone call to the owners mobile number by its GSM Sheild engaged with it. We used components like
1. Arduino Uno
2. 5V Relay
3. Servo Motor
4. Buzzer and LED
5. 16*2 LCD display
6. MQ9 Gas sensor
7. GSM Sheild
